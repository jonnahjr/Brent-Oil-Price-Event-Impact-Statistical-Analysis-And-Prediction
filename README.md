# Change Point Analysis and Statistical Modelling of Time Series Data - Detecting Changes and Associating causes on Time Series Data

## KAIM Weak 10 Challenge

### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the impact of significant global events on Brent oil prices over the past few decades, focusing on political decisions, regional conflicts, economic sanctions, and OPEC policy changes. By detecting change points in time series data and analyzing the statistical impact of these events, we provide actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and energy companies. The project involves comprehensive data analysis and model building to predict price fluctuations and understand contributing factors.

As part of **Birhan Energies**, a consultancy dedicated to data-driven insights in the energy sector, this project helps our stakeholders make informed decisions in a volatile market environment.

### Task Breakdown

The project is divided into multiple tasks to facilitate a structured approach to data analysis and model development.

#### Task 1: Define Data Analysis Workflow and Understand the Model
- **Objective:** Plan the analysis workflow and ensure a solid understanding of the data and statistical models.
  - Outline the steps involved in analyzing the data.
  - Familiarize with time series models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH).
  - Identify model inputs, parameters, and limitations.

#### Task 2: Time Series Analysis and Model Application
- **Objective:** Build on foundational knowledge to analyze Brent oil prices.
  - Utilize statistical and econometric models (e.g., VAR, Markov-Switching ARIMA, LSTM) for complex pattern detection.
  - Analyze economic indicators (GDP, inflation, unemployment) and their relationship to oil prices.
  - Explore political, regulatory, and technological factors that influence oil prices.

#### Task 3: Interactive Dashboard Development
- **Objective:** Create a user-friendly dashboard to visualize analysis results.
  - Develop a Flask-based backend and a React frontend for a seamless experience.
  - Present historical trends, forecasts, and correlations with events through interactive visualizations.

### Folder Structure
